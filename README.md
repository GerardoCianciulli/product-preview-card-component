## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- React
- Typescript

### What I learned

I learned how to pass components as props, with Typescript, which was necessary for passing an SVG as an icon within my button component. This allows me to change the icon to create various types off buttons for future.

```jsx
type ButtonProps = {
    icon: React.ComponentType<{}>
}

const Button = ({ icon: Icon }: ButtonProps) => {
    return (
        <button>
            <Icon />
        </button>)
}
```
